# Ruby and Travis are Getting Married!

## Some links for this:

[Website](https://rubytraviswedding.github.io)
[Registry]() (Coming soon!)

## Contributions

I am not looking for contributors to this project, but if you need a wedding webstie for yourself, you are welcome to fork this and change everything.

However, I do not give permission to impersonate my wedding website. That would be rude.

## Setting up your own

*This is a basic setup with just an HTML page, a CSS page, and a JavaScript page, so knowledge of each would be prerequisite, but most any dev environment and browser should be able to handle editing and running this.*

Setup:
1. Fork this repo with a new repo name:
  - E.g. `<username>.github.io`
  - The key to deploying with Github pages is to include that magical `.github.io` domain.
  - See the [Github Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) for more
2. Change Ruby and Travis' names to yours and your partner's.
3. Add whatever assets like photos you wish
4. Style however you wish
5. Push the repo to Github and within 20 minutes or so, you have a deployed custom wedding website for FREE

## Testing and iterating

- In your CLI navigate to the root folder of your project, use:
```sh
open index.html
```
- Or from a GUI right click the `index.html` file and open it in your browser of choice.
- To see each change, save your changes and refresh the age in the browser.
