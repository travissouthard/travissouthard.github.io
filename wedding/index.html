                <h3>September 3, 2021</h3>
                <p>We got legally married with a small group of local friends as witnesses. This was a self-uniting ceremony where we made our own vows to each other. We also took our marriage license to City Hall to drop it off and be officially married!</p>
                <p><a href="#vows" target="_blank">You can watch our vows here.</a></p>
