### Bio
I am new to programming as a hard skill, but my career so far has prepared me to think creatively about problems and how to break them down to small parts to manage them bit by bit.
My experiences as a freelance producer have taught me so much about the creative process and working to meet client needs. My time as a bike mechanic taught me how to assess, repair, and build specific, process-heavy systems.
Whether building code, a short film, or a bicycle; I develop an appropriate process, assemble the tools and parts I need, and follow that process to build something both useful and beautiful.
