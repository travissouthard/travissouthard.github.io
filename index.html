                Recently returned from a ten day vacation in Lisbon, Portugal to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. This
                is the longest trip I've taken since Ruby and I spent three weeks in Ireland for our honeymoon in 2022. We
                stayed in a cute apartment with a garden and walking proximity to the city center. In and around Lisbon, we
                were able to walk and ride trains and busses to most of the places we wanted to visit and that was such a
