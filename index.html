                Coming through feeling sick and just in time for day light savings, which snuck up on me this year. Usually I am
                watching for it like a hawk, but this winter I was very focused on trying to enjoy what wintriness we got. With
                less than two weeks from the spring equinox, I am hoping we get a few weeks of actual spring weather before the
                heat of summer sets in.

                New year. I am newly 35 years old and just came through a tough but still good year. Many
