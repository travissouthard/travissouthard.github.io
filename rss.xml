            <title>September Updates and October Upcoming</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/assets/images/blog/sunset-graveyard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset over a local church and graveyard&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
  
            &lt;p&gt;
                I have some updates from the past week and a &lt;em&gt;content schedule&lt;/em&gt; for the next month!
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Firstly I am honored that last Monday I was named one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://technical.ly/&quot;
                    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Technical.ly&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://technical.ly/software-development/philly-reallist-engineers-2023/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RealLIST
                    Engineers of Philadephia for 2023&lt;/a&gt;! It always feels nice to be recognized for work and this is the first
                professional recognition I&apos;ve received since transitioning into tech. I am especially honored that my work with
                &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code for Philly&lt;/a&gt; was specifically mentioned because I am
                incredibly proud of the work that I&apos;ve done there over the past three years.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Speaking of Code for Philly, my second update this week is that I am stepping up to join Code for Philly&apos;s
                leadership team as the Operations Lead. Over the next few months I will be learning more about the different
                projects we facilitate, who the players are (that I don&apos;t already know), and what needs and strengths each
                project team has. I will also be supporting the teams&apos; operational needs like making sure teams have the tools
                they need to thrive. I have loved volunteering on the &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement&quot;
                    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLSE Expungement team&lt;/a&gt; for
                the past three years and will continue to support them as team lead until a new lead is fully in place.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                My final update from the week is that I have put in some work on updates to &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/&quot;&gt;my personal website and portfolio&lt;/a&gt;! I
                have made the home page a little less scattered so that now it only shows my most recent
                projects, blogs, and pixel art pieces. There is also a separate about page so that it is easier to link to. The
                biggest change is that the projects, blogs, and pixel art all have their own pages. Each of the pages shows a
                list of the content and when clicked on, shows a detailed view with the ability to navigate to previous and next
                posts.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                This change felt relevant to my interest in writing blogs, doing streams, and making more pixel art. The thought
                was &quot;If I will be making more content, it should be easier to look at content on my portfolio.&quot; Granted this has
                been an
                upgrade to my website I have been wanting to do for a long time. But of course, priorities for a long time were
                elsewhere and finally I was able to make those changes. There&apos;s always more to do but I&apos;m pleased with this
                update and excited to post more and find need for things like pagination and a more robust database than a JSON
                file.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                Speaking of content: I made a content schedule for myself for the next month! I am still figuring out a good way
                to do streams from my refurbished early-2015 MacBook Pro, so those will not be announced yet, but I will be sure
                to post them when they are officially scheduled. For now what I can say is that they will be Mondays from 7-9pm
                Eastern Time. The blogs though are certainly ready to be sheduled! In the month of October, I will be
                publishing:
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;October 8&lt;/b&gt;: Minesweeper Tutorial (this is a big post)&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;October 15&lt;/b&gt;: Money, Tech, &amp; Motivation&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;October 22&lt;/b&gt;: Code Should Be Smaller&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;October 28&lt;/b&gt;: Monthly updates and next schedule (similar to this post)&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The titles and topics may change, like everything in life, really. And once streaming is figured out I will add
                that to the schedule as well. But, like always, the best way to keep up with this blog is to subscribe to &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog&apos;s RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; and to my &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv75JMz-8JkuhGZVRBbrZbQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subscribe to my
                    YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; where I&apos;ll be streaming (once I figure out the tech for it). You&apos;re also welcome to join
                the test streams as they pop up.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Web development streams coming soon!</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/assets/images/blog/travis-flowers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Travis holding a bouquet of flowers in a field of flowers!&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
  
            &lt;p&gt;
                I have been working on personal projects in my spare time for a few weeks: stepping into a leadership role at &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code for
                    Philly&lt;/a&gt;, writing tutorials for upcoming streaming I&apos;ll be doing, and working with Ruby to improve our
                house.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The &lt;a href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement&quot;
                    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLSE Expungement team at Code for Philly&lt;/a&gt; has been putting in a ton of work lately and I
                am thrilled to work with such stellar volunteers. I recently wrote a &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement/updates/5&quot;
                    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new
                    update&lt;/a&gt; for our project page
                talking about the progress we&apos;ve made over the past year. We&apos;re actively accepting new volunteers if
                you live in Philly and are interested in meaningful work and expanding your skills.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I decided to start writing out tutorials for weekend-sized projects in browser-only,
                native tech (i.e. just HTML, CSS and JavaScript). I have one tutorial completely done, a second almost ready,
                and
                a third one in the wings. Once I have all three done I will start hosting &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv75JMz-8JkuhGZVRBbrZbQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weekly streams&lt;/a&gt;
                teaching those
                tutorials as well as working through personal projects and pixel art. I plan to do those bigger tutorials
                monthly and edit them into more digestible videos and written blogs. I have found a lack of beginner-friendly
                written content in this area and am seeking to fill that gap.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                There&apos;s a few motivations for doing the streaming and content creation despite &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/blog.html?post=cautiously-considering-creating-content&quot;
                    target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;being concerned about getting back into creating content&lt;/a&gt;. One is that I do like making
                videos. I spent years growing my video production skills and genuinely love making them. Another is that with
                the streaming, writing, and developing, I will become a better developer and
                continue growing my skills. The last is that I am interested in doing more independent work and that likely
                means trying to grow an audience (Hi!) and build out some options beyond just working for a boss.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                That being said, I still plan to work full-time and you should&lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/assets/Travis_Southard_Software_Engineer_Resume.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hire
                    me full time as a Software Engineer&lt;/a&gt;, I am certainly still interested in working on
                civic technology and geospatial projects that improve people&apos;s lives. Doing work that is meaningful to me will
                always be one of the most important factors in how I choose to spend my days. A salary and healthcare are
                important to
                me but I work best when I am working to make the world a better place. And that&apos;s a huge part of why I&apos;m
                interested in trying to take more of my workday decisions into my own hands. My goal with these projects is to
                plant seeds so that I can begin to cultivate a career aligned with my values.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                The best way to keep up with what&apos;s happening is to check here or subscribe to &lt;a
                    href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog&apos;s RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;. To see my upcoming
                streams &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv75JMz-8JkuhGZVRBbrZbQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;subscribe to my
                    YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; where I&apos;ll be streaming them.

            <title>Expungement Petition Generator</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From the project page: The project we are 
                currently working on is building out an expungement 
                petition generator for PLSE. The application takes in 
                PDFs of clients&apos; criminal dockets and returns fully 
                formatted petitions to expunge the clients&apos; criminal 
                records. Having a clear criminal record helps those 
                clients to better find work, housing, and services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

            <title>Cautiously considering creating content</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/assets/images/blog/cityview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Gray buildings amongst green trees under a blue sky. A dithered pixel-art of a view of Fairmount, The Art Museum, the Schuylkill River, and the ridges beyond.&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
  
      &lt;p&gt;
        I have been arguing with myself for a while now about getting back into &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;content creation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for the
        past few years. I have started and &lt;s&gt;abandoned&lt;/s&gt; moved on from &lt;a
            href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99BRZOOC30s&amp;list=PL8hP1JY9f2dh7vnCpoVDSIknMWIk4s55H&amp;pp=gAQBiAQB&quot;
            target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;so many projects&lt;/a&gt; over the years. None of them necessarily &quot;gained traction&quot;, but I also
        never gave things enough time to really find their audience. I&apos;ve been consistently thinking for a year now that
        I did enjoy making those things at the time and probably would again.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          Theoretically this is the &quot;right reason&quot; to be &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;creating content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Just feeling a drive to make
          things. However, I really despise the phrase/title &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;content creator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt; for both its
          hand-wavey vagueness and especially the implication that one is not a filmmaker or an illustrator or a writer
          but a machine akin to a meat grinder whose main output is &quot;stuff&quot;. This is especially shakey ground to even
          acknowledge considering AI generated &lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;content&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But I suppose I am considering making intentional, scheduled work again. And while I am not quitting my day job
          (certainly not in week 3), I do have an interest in trying to grow an audience and add some commerce to the art.
          And thats where I start to get nervous: When I have started to treat making things for fun as a job they have
          gotten less fun. Specifically resenting time pressure, feeling like I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to make a thing &lt;em&gt;or
              else&lt;/em&gt;, and that the things I am making are just not good. Often I felt like the &quot;just to get it done&quot;
          factor was hurting how I felt about making things.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          Granted, I say all that and yet: I was always far happier having made the thing and seeing it posted than I ever
          was not posting the things that didn&apos;t make it. I genuinely enjoy the act of editing a video, hand-placing a
          pixel, and writing a blog post. Making things is fun, and as long as it stays fun I&apos;ll be happy to make things.
          If I can continue to make things that make me happy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; make some income from it without feeling burned
          out by it, then that would be genuinely dreamy.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          This is not an announcement of anything in particular. I don&apos;t have a specific plan right now, but I suppose
          keep an ear out because I&apos;ll be making &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; soon. Which of course reminds me to remind you that
          you can get this blog delivered to you automatically by subscribing to &lt;a
              href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the RSS
              feed&lt;/a&gt; I maintain for &lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com&quot;&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;!
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
          So definitely no promises, but lately I have been interested in:
          &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;making code tutorials at an intermediate level for both small projects and language proficiencies&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;writing articles about better documentation and project/code organizing&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;posting about current projects I&apos;m working on in a journal blog style&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Now with permalinks!</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/assets/images/blog/permalink.png&quot; alt=&quot;A recursive screenshot of this blog post in tinier and tinier images as they recursively recede into themselves.&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
  
      &lt;p&gt;I have been trying to keep &lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/&quot;&gt;this portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and its parts pretty simple
        and lightweight. Part of this is wanting to
        use free services as much as possible, but part of it is to keep my vanilla Javascript skills up to snuff. It
        also may be my recent interest in &lt;a href=&quot;https://permacomputing.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;permacomputing as
        well as a great disdain for overcomplicated (and data-sucking) big tech products.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Sometimes though it means I miss out on some features that come a little more &quot;out of the box.&quot; I met up with a
          former colleague last week and we were talking about just this issue. He pointed out that while he has been
          enjoying reading these, there was no way to link to a particular post. Well no more!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I did some work this morning to add support for permalinks with these posts despite not using a backend or
          database. The solution I adopted here was to use query parameters from the url and a custom function to create
          slugs from the post titles as unique-ish identifiers. This was pretty easy to set up, luckily, and you can look
          at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/travissouthard/travissouthard.github.io/pull/23&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;what I did to
              put this
              together here&lt;/a&gt;. This also gave the the ability to refactor some functions to better organize what is
          happening where and add the navigation buttons to the top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/blog.html&quot;&gt;the
              blog page&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Granted, this current system using a javascript array in a &lt;code&gt;.js&lt;/code&gt; file will only last so many more
          posts before I want to convert this to using a database, but I have genuinely been enjoying this set up and &lt;a
              href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/blog.html?post=brand-new-rss-feed&quot;&gt;the custom RSS generator&lt;/a&gt; to put
          these together. My tolerance for a too-long file may grow as that file does.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There is something powerful about mastering the &quot;simpler&quot; or lower-level skills in coding. I felt this way when
          digging more deeply into bash scripting, C, and SQL queries the last few years. But I think that since I am most
          interested in building out things for the web, I will continue to work in vanilla (or close to) Javascript and
          try to make things as lightweight as can also be readable (and maintainable).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Moreso than feeling more like a wizard with code, I am feeling good about having my own online space to put the
          weird
          things I am working on or just what is interesting me at any time. It is also nice to feel like I have more
          control over the presentation of that space and its &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;. I am not necessarily interested in
          becoming a &lt;em&gt;Content Creator&amp;trade;&lt;/em&gt;, I am interested in sharing what I make, how I make it, and
          especially in helping others to learn how to create spaces like these for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;These posts still feel good to write and especially to see them update in my RSS reader. These will likely
          continue to be a mix of project updates and personal blogs. I got a lot of good feedback on &lt;a
              href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/blog.html?post=i-need-a-better-routine&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
          have &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; improved the way I am spending my days, but that is a whole other work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>I need a better routine</title>
            <description>&lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/assets/images/blog/raystown-camp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A dithered photo of our campsite from our recent vacation to Raystown Lake PA. Featureing our camp chairs in front of our campfire pizza, our borrowed tent and our two hammocks near the lake.&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
  
      &lt;p&gt;I am still very much on &lt;a href=&quot;./assets/Travis_Southard_Software_Engineer_Resume.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the job
            search&lt;/a&gt;. I am actively seeking a full-time (though ideally 32-hours-a-week) software engineering position
        in civic technology with geospatial work. I have had some great conversations and opportunities so far and I
        hope I can find something I love very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While I have been home, I was hoping to establish a new routine that honors my physical, emotional, and
        interpersonal needs. Ruby recently prompted me to imagine my ideal life and I struggled to even begin. I
        have the ability and strength to imagine a better world, improvements to my city, and even fantasy elements, but
        apparently not my ideal day. I also recently thought about this issue because of a &lt;a
            href=&quot;https://www.raptitude.com/2010/07/your-lifestyle-has-already-been-designed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;great
            (13-year-old) blog post about feeling helpless about how we spend our non-work time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But recently, Ruby and I did a 4-day camping trip at Raystown Lake in Central PA. We drove out on a Monday,
        brought our mountain bikes, an enormous borrowed tent, and a new cooler full of lovely foods to eat. At camp, I
        found I was able to live more like I want:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;woke up at about 7am&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;took care of my morning hygiene routine&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;started making coffee and read a book&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;made breakfast while Ruby writes her morning pages&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;eat breakfast and review my plan for the day&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;do the plan for the morning (ride mountain bikes!)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;make and eat lunch&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;do the plan for the afternoon (swim, read, explore)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;make and eat dinner&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;enjoy a drink and spend quality time with loved ones (look at stars, birds, and bugs with Ruby)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;take care of my evening hygiene routine&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;in bed at about 10pm&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have felt this feeling before; that I feel better at camp than I do at home. This was a large part of why I did
        so much bike camping from 2016 to 2019 and tried to make bike touring my job a few years back. I have recognized
        that a campsite is a better environment for me than the one I make for myself at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Granted, that does not mean I understand the solution suddenly. When Ruby and I were talking about this the other
        day, she asked me what made the difference. I wasn&apos;t really sure, but I did say, &quot;WiFi.&quot; And I think there&apos;s
        some truth to that. I tend to stay up too late clicking on another YouTube video, or scrolling down a social
        media feed, or finding another reason to avoid bedtime. Part of this is a very ADHD struggle with transitioning
        activities, but I think I also feel resistant to be done with the day (even though all of those activities just
        reinforce that I am, in fact, done). Those late nights make it harder to get up when I want to and everything
        gets thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have come to recognize that I am far more capable of harder and more complex tasks in the morning, whether
        that&apos;s work, chores, or even a hobby. I was good at building that into my last job by blocking off the start of
        my day through 1 or 2pm. I think trying to build my day more like that above schedule is going to really help me
        just feel like I&apos;m living more fully.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Especially the idea that I would have a morning block for harder things to do and an afternoon block for easier
        or less complex things to do. Another huge thing that I have really been needing more and more is to
        specifically leave the house and bring my computer to a cafe or do chores outside the house (including outside
        my own backyard). I just don&apos;t go outside nearly enough if I don&apos;t already have a &quot;thing&quot; to go to. So it&apos;s up
        to me and my adult self to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yes, the schedule above is simple, but having that as an established habit will be better than the current habit:
        Just throwing myself at tasks and feeling paralyzed so I just avoid them while falling in scroll holes until
        they are too urgent to avoid. To
        no surprise; that feels awful. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I genuinely believe that establishing such a routine would help me shake some of
        the executive dysfunction I&apos;ve
        been feeling lately. Not to mention it will help me really feel like I&apos;m living up to my potential and living a
        fulfilling and
        actually restful life. Building habits is very hard, but I have done it before and can do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Solved a tricky (for me) docker-compose error!</title>
            <description>
  
      &lt;p&gt;I am currently volunteering on a project as part of &lt;a
            href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/projects/third_places_project-launchpad_2023&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code for
            Philly&apos;s Launchpad 2023&lt;/a&gt;. I am working with a small team of developers and UXers to develop a project
        that will seek to connect Philadelphians to comfortable public spaces, with the focus being on finding places
        spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;#solution&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Jump to code solution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We got started at the end of March this year and the launchpad demos will be &lt;a
              href=&quot;https://opencollective.com/code-for-philly/events/2023-code-for-philly-launchpad-project-showcase-c95b1dc3&quot;
              target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on May 10&lt;/a&gt; as part of
          &lt;a href=&quot;https://2023.phillytechweek.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Philly Tech Week 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Come see our presentation!
          For the past few weeks we have been simultaneously going
          through the discovery of what we want to build and setting up the boilerplate to build our code on.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;One speed bump I ran into was setting up a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file. In my work life and in my &lt;a
              href=&quot;https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement&quot;&gt;other
              Code for
              Philly project&lt;/a&gt;, we use these to build, run, and manage our Docker containers for the frontend, backend,
          and
          database. However, I realized this week I have never set one up from scratch since those above projects were
          either already built or built from a template we couldn&apos;t use for this project.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For context, we are going to be building a React frontend with Leaflet for our map component, and a Django
          backend with PostgreSQL and PostGIS. We also decided to set up React with Vite to avoid create-react-app.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Setting up the Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml file were easy enough using the Docker setup documentation. I
          made sure each docker container built and ran on its own, but when putting them together with compose, I was
          getting this error from Docker:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;error: cannot resolve import from &apos;vite&apos; from vite.config.ts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;After a lot of searching, looking at forums and docs, and trying many different things, this error mostly pointed
          to the idea that vite is missing. Where a lot of the solutions pointed to an old issue with Node 14, Typescript,
          and Vite and that solving it with updating Node to 16, that wouldn&apos;t work for us since we are using Node 18.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I checked to make sure it was in the package.json, and making sure that npm install was running successfully. And
          there I found it: Despite, the Dockerfile calling for &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to run when building, the logs
          showed it wasn&apos;t actually running.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;The solution I found pointed to using the following line in the Dockerfile in our React app:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
      # From: 
      ADD . .
      RUN npm install
      CMD [&quot;npm&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;dev&quot;, &quot;--host&quot;]
      # To: 
      # See the PR for the full Dockerfile.
      ADD . .
      ENTRYPOINT [ &quot;/entrypoint.sh&quot; ]
      CMD [&quot;npm&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;dev&quot;, &quot;--host&quot;]
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And of course adding that entrypoint.hs file with:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
      #!/bin/sh
      npm install
      npm rebuild esbuild
      exec &quot;$@&quot;
      &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;npm rebuild&lt;/code&gt; is there as a precaution for a problem I was running into with the wrong esbuild
          coming from the Docker host, but using that entry point file did successfully get the node_modules installed
          with the correct esbuild and now we are happily boilerplated and ready to roll building out as much of our demo
          as we can in the next week!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit: 6/16/23 - Fixed a tab error in the code portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;PhilaVibes is a map application that helps people in 
        Philadelphia at point A with more time than they need to get to point B 
        find a comfortable place to be between those spaces. The map will 
        feature points surrounded by word clouds describing the spaces (and 
        will show the name, address, etc, once the user clicks on that space). 
        The user can see choose to see spaces around them, along their route, 
        or around their destination. Philavibes started as a

            <title>Brand new RSS feed!</title>
            <description>
  &lt;p&gt;This is the first dedicated blog post as an attempt to 
      make a blog from scratch that can be read by RSS readers. I have been 
      wanting to make this for some time and finally made the time to figure 
      out how to do this on a static site and without having to write out XML 
      code by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I have been redoing my portfolio site recently and wanted to sit down
      and figure this out. I wrote a basic JavaScript script to parse a data 
      object I was already using for the portfolio and made a way to generate 
      XML code from it. The code is pretty simple but I will include it at the 
      bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I make no promises about the frequency of how often I will be making 
      posts here, but will update with new code projects and pixel art pieces 
      as they come up. But really, that&apos;s the beauty of using an RSS reader: 
      The reader checks for you!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the past year or so I have really re-fallen in love with using an 
      RSS reader to keep up with blogs, webcomics, and a few other things that 
      post irregularly (or that I used to follow on Twitter). It feels good to 
      read through and empty out my feed each day and really helps me to keep 
      up with creators and companies with ease. I have been using NetNewsWire&apos;s 
      iOS app for a few weeks and like how it works, especially the &quot;reader&quot; 
      view.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Go ahead and add &lt;a href=&quot;https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml&quot; 
      target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml&lt;/a&gt; to your reader of 
      choice.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: I cleaned up how the rss is generated and adding HTML tags 
      to actually show the images and organize my writing better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/travissouthard/travissouthard.github.io/blob/master/generateRssXml.js&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;code here&lt;/a&gt;</description>

            <title>Why is some documentation better than others?</title>
            <description>
  
      &lt;p&gt;In fall of 2022, I wrote a blog post for 
      work on what makes for good documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;Documentation is vital for anything open source; from open 
      hardware, to free recipes, to DIY repair tutorials, but it is especially 
      vital when it comes to software. Whether you&apos;re a user or a developer, 
      documentation provides the “how to” for interacting with any piece of 
      software.&lt;br/&gt;
      Since I first started getting into software development two years ago, 
      I&apos;ve learned that documentation frequently assumes you already know how 
      to use the item in question, and are using the docs as a reference. 
      While acting as a reference material is one of documentation&apos;s important 
      functions, it cannot be the only function...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
