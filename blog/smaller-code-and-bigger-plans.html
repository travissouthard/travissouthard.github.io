            <p>
                Over the past few weeks I have released a tutorial to make the classic video game, Minesweeper, from scratch
                using native web tools (being HTML, CSS, and Javascript). (Check out parts <a 
                    href="./blog.html?post=how-to-make-minesweeper-part-1" target="_blank">1</a>, <a 
                    href="./blog.html?post=how-to-make-minesweeper-part-2" target="_blank">2</a>, & <a 
                    href="./blog.html?post=how-to-make-minesweeper-part-3" target="_blank">3</a>!) I was motivated to write tutorials in general to help
                new developers bridge the gap between what they currently know and what they need to know to get a job
                developing code. The other half of that motivation is to help me become a better developer by teaching.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose to write tutorials about native web tools because developers do need to know what the browser is
                actually reading and rendering and why it does what it does. Part of this is that frameworks and libraries
                compile down to HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so developers should be aware of what is happening 'under the hood.' I
                was taught to try to be aware of how the tech is working at least one or two layers down to ensure my code will
                behave how I want it to. The other part of that motivation has been feeling more and more that we should be
                delivering smaller websites to end users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been reading a lot of work around <a href="http://permacomputing.net/"
                    target="_blank">permacomputing</a>, <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/" target="_blank">more
                    sustainable technology</a>, and <a
                    href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-digital-closet-how-the-internet-became-straight-alexander-monea/17170660?ean=9780262545952"
                    target="_blank">making the web better for
                    people</a>, including <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/you-deserve-a-tech-union"
                    target="_blank">developers</a>. And one of the easiest ways I can do that as a developer is to write my
                own code that is easier on both storage and compute power and also to encourage others to do the same. One of
                <a href="http://permacomputing.net/Principles/" target="_blank">permacomputing's principles</a> is to "Keep
                it small" since:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Small systems are more likely to have small hardware and energy requirements, as well as high understandability.
                They are easier to understand, manage, refactor and repurpose. -<a href="http://permacomputing.net/Principles/"
                    target="_blank">Permacomputing Principles page</a>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                There's certainly more to permacomputing and sustainability than just making things smaller, and there is also a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf" target="_blank">"code golf"</a> tradeoff where the code
                becomes so small that it makes it harder to understand and thus will be harder to maintain. This blog and my
                portfolio site in general are built as just a static webpage and the only library I'm using is JQuery, though it
                could be rewritten in vanilla Javascript. Granted, there are downsides to this setup: one is that I cannot tell how many
                people are visiting the site unless they tell me directly. For now this is fine since I am writing these for fun
                and practice more than relying on them for any sort of income just yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the lines of not knowing who is reading, I have no plans to track readers ever. User tracking is
                creepy and invasive. I personally use tools to protect my privacy as much as I can, and I recommend you do too.
                At some point, I will want to know how many times posts are being read (and if possible how many unique readers,
                if there is a non-tracking way to do that). I currently have the site and blog hosted on GitHub Pages, which is
                easy to use and free. But to start seeing some readership numbers, I would have to set up my own server. I would
                like to do this anyway to improve how I'm coding the different posts, to fulfill my own DIY desires, and to take
                more control over my work and the resources it uses.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, I am reasonably happy with this site. It serves my need of having a consistent site for software
                projects, pixel art, and blog posts. One of my <code>TODOs</code> is to create a <code>resume.html</code> page
                with a list of all my past jobs and download link for <a
                    href="./assets/travis_southard_software_engineer_resume.pdf" target="_blank">the PDF</a>. If you enjoy what
                I'm building here, please consider <a href="https://ko-fi.com/travissouthard">supporting my work</a> to help me
                make more tutorials, blogs, pixel art, and everything.
