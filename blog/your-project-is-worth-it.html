                <p>
                    After reading a blog post from <a href="https://www.solarshades.club/p/against-thermochauvinism"
                        target="_blank">Andrew Dana Hudson about thermochauvinism</a>, I have begun referring to July as "Hot
                    Winter," a time of year when I spend most of my time indoors because it is uncomfortable and even dangerous
                    to be outside. I tend to spend my free time similarly to actual winter: video games, home DIY, reading,
                    taking care of house plants, and wishing I could ride my bike or work in my garden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As soon as the heat broke last week I went out and went on a longer mountain bike ride than usual. It felt
                    wonderful to be out on the trails, using my body, and just gazing at water, birds, and plants. Riding a bike
                    is almost always just a shortcut to feeling better for me. Physical exertion and fresh air do wonderful for
                    my dopamine producers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first week of June, I rode with a friend on <a href="https://grinduro.com/pennsylvania/"
                        target="_blank">Grinduro PA</a>, a 70(-ish) mile gravel and single-track ride in and out of Loyalsock
                    State Forest. It was a challenge but I was pretty in shape for it, though I could certainly have used more
                    training on climbing specifically. It was a great time and worth doing if for nothing else than reminding me
                    I am capable and enjoy days where "all you have to do is ride you bike" as one of my Bike & Build teammates
                    puts it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having done that ride towards the start of the summer has been good for me in riding casually afterward and
                    having a recent difficult accomplishment to comapre against when a ride or section of a ride starts feeling
                    like a slog. I have also been feeling this in my day job lately. Getting stuck on a particular issue and
                    strugglig to find a solution, but pushing through with memories of solving past tough problems or errors and
                    remembering the satisfaction of having beat those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is such a hard thing to overcome when working on any project: A problem without an obvious solution and
                    little findable community support. These are awful and can end a project without enough skill, motivation,
                    or some combination of the two. I have always struggled with asking for help and been too stubborn with
                    myself that I can <em>definitely</em> find the answer on this next search around. Luckily I have great
                    colleagues and peers who are happy to work through a problem with me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For other developers (or anyone working on any shape of project): Please ask your peers, community, and
                    colleagues for help. Your project is worth completing <em>or at least worth getting to a proof-of-concept
                        well enough to know it's worth abandoning</em>.
                </p>
