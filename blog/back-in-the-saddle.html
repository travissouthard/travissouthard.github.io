                After a few weeks working at my new job and settling into new habits, there's a part of me that feels like I'm
                waking up from something. I really did not enjoy my last job. While I knew it was temporary, I still resented
                the forty hours a week spent working with no benefits on a project that I found equally interesting and
                frustrating to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
                My therapist mentioned back in December that I had been stressed about work for about a year at that point since
                it had just been announced that Azavea would be acquired <i>while</i> I was going through a performance
                improvement plan. And for the months leading up to and following the acquisition felt like shaky ground before
                being laid off in May.
            </p>
            <p>
                Happily, after taking a few weeks off before starting at CLS, and with two weeks of learning new tools, legal
                terms, and company culture, I have really felt myself standing up straighter. I have felt like I am more aware
                of my surroundings. I have felt like that feeling where I suddenly come into focus and realize I have been
                staring into space for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remarked to Ruby a few weeks ago that I was feeling a low-level anxiety that was a similar feeling to
                waking up from a nightmare. That feeling where you know you're safe, but are still feeling scared and processing
                what it was you just went through. My last job was far from a nightmare, but I really wanted to be in a
                values-based space and really have been enjoying having that again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also been biking more including mountain biking and that feels wonderful! My friend, Pat, convinced me to
                sign up for <a href="https://grinduro.com/pennsylvania/" target="_blank">Grinduro PA</a> this coming June. It's
                a 70-mile gravel ride through Central PA and I have not done any ride that long in over four years, let alone on
                unpaved roads. I said yes, first because I love riding with Pat, but also I have been wanting to get back into
                good riding shape and this essentially puts a deadline on that. <i>Note: "In shape" is incredibly relative and
                    for me it's the ability to spontaneously be able to do a 60+ mile ride (if my schedule allows) when a friend
                    asks me.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting back out on my mountain bike feels great and I am happy to be spending more time in the woods. A few
                days ago was my first ride since probably last July or August. While I felt shaky that first ride, a few days in
                I am starting to feel more confident again and able to get past some of the tricky obstacles I learned to
                navigate last year.
            </p>

                Between my new job, co-directing <a href="https://codeforphilly.org/" target="_blank">Code for Philly</a>,
                organizing <a href="https://socialjusticehackathon.github.io/website/about.html" target="_blank">a hackathon</a>
                and a renewed cycling habit, I am feeling great both inside and out and hopefully I'm setting a sustainable pace
                for myself. Because I genuinely love how this is feeling.
