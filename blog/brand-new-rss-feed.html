        <p>This is the first dedicated blog post as an attempt to 
      make a blog from scratch that can be read by RSS readers. I have been 
      wanting to make this for some time and finally made the time to figure 
      out how to do this on a static site and without having to write out XML 
      code by hand.</p>
      <p>I have been redoing my portfolio site recently and wanted to sit down
      and figure this out. I wrote a basic JavaScript script to parse a data 
      object I was already using for the portfolio and made a way to generate 
      XML code from it. The code is pretty simple but I will include it at the 
      bottom of this post.</p>
      <p>I make no promises about the frequency of how often I will be making 
      posts here, but will update with new code projects and pixel art pieces 
      as they come up. But really, that's the beauty of using an RSS reader: 
      The reader checks for you!</p>
      <p>For the past year or so I have really re-fallen in love with using an 
      RSS reader to keep up with blogs, webcomics, and a few other things that 
      post irregularly (or that I used to follow on Twitter). It feels good to 
      read through and empty out my feed each day and really helps me to keep 
      up with creators and companies with ease. I have been using NetNewsWire's 
      iOS app for a few weeks and like how it works, especially the "reader" 
      view.</p>
      <p>Go ahead and add <a href="https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml" 
      target="blank">https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml</a> to your reader of 
      choice.</p>
      <p><em>Edit: I cleaned up how the rss is generated and adding HTML tags 
      to actually show the images and organize my writing better.</em></p>
