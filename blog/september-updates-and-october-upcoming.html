                I have some updates from the past week and a <em>content schedule</em> for the next month!
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly I am honored that last Monday I was named one of <a href="https://technical.ly/"
                    target="_blank">Technical.ly</a>'s <a
                    href="https://technical.ly/software-development/philly-reallist-engineers-2023/" target="_blank">RealLIST
                    Engineers of Philadephia for 2023</a>! It always feels nice to be recognized for work and this is the first
                professional recognition I've received since transitioning into tech. I am especially honored that my work with
                <a href="https://codeforphilly.org/" target="_blank">Code for Philly</a> was specifically mentioned because I am
                incredibly proud of the work that I've done there over the past three years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of Code for Philly, my second update this week is that I am stepping up to join Code for Philly's
                leadership team as the Operations Lead. Over the next few months I will be learning more about the different
                projects we facilitate, who the players are (that I don't already know), and what needs and strengths each
                project team has. I will also be supporting the teams' operational needs like making sure teams have the tools
                they need to thrive. I have loved volunteering on the <a
                    href="https://codeforphilly.org/projects/philadelphia_lawyers_for_social_equity_-_record_expungement"
                    target="_blank">PLSE Expungement team</a> for
                the past three years and will continue to support them as team lead until a new lead is fully in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                My final update from the week is that I have put in some work on updates to <a
                    href="https://travissouthard.com/">my personal website and portfolio</a>! I
                have made the home page a little less scattered so that now it only shows my most recent
                projects, blogs, and pixel art pieces. There is also a separate about page so that it is easier to link to. The
                biggest change is that the projects, blogs, and pixel art all have their own pages. Each of the pages shows a
                list of the content and when clicked on, shows a detailed view with the ability to navigate to previous and next
                posts.
            </p>
            <p>
                This change felt relevant to my interest in writing blogs, doing streams, and making more pixel art. The thought
                was "If I will be making more content, it should be easier to look at content on my portfolio." Granted this has
                been an
                upgrade to my website I have been wanting to do for a long time. But of course, priorities for a long time were
                elsewhere and finally I was able to make those changes. There's always more to do but I'm pleased with this
                update and excited to post more and find need for things like pagination and a more robust database than a JSON
                file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of content: I made a content schedule for myself for the next month! I am still figuring out a good way
                to do streams from my refurbished early-2015 MacBook Pro, so those will not be announced yet, but I will be sure
                to post them when they are officially scheduled. For now what I can say is that they will be Mondays from 7-9pm
                Eastern Time. The blogs though are certainly ready to be sheduled! In the month of October, I will be
                publishing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>October 8</b>: Minesweeper Tutorial (this is a big post)</li>
                <li><b>October 15</b>: Money, Tech, & Motivation</li>
                <li><b>October 22</b>: Code Should Be Smaller</li>
                <li><b>October 28</b>: Monthly updates and next schedule (similar to this post)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The titles and topics may change, like everything in life, really. And once streaming is figured out I will add
                that to the schedule as well. But, like always, the best way to keep up with this blog is to subscribe to <a
                    href="https://travissouthard.com/rss.xml" target="_blank">this blog's RSS feed</a> and to my <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv75JMz-8JkuhGZVRBbrZbQ" target="_blank">subscribe to my
                    YouTube channel</a> where I'll be streaming (once I figure out the tech for it). You're also welcome to join
                the test streams as they pop up.
            </p>
