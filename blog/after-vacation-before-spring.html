                Excited to see that the sunlight is just starting to stick around after 6pm lately. A few hours of extra
                sunlight really makes a difference to my mood. Weirdly enough the snow in Philadelphia the past few weeks
                has had a similar effect. Ruby and I have been taking the time to go hiking or walking on some good local
                trails and walking over snow and seeing the snowdrops peeking out of the ground has been a big boost against our
                winter dreading. (Also I recently found out <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/snowdrops" target="_blank">are
                    poisonous if ingested</a>!)
            </p>
            <p>
                Ruby and I just spent a week in Morocco visiting a friend who has been living there. It was delightful to
                visit our friends, walk around some ancient cities, and exercise our language skills (I retained more
                conversational French than I thought!). We were very happy to have a friend who has been living as a local as
                out guide since there were some serious cultural differences around tipping for services, shopping, and police
                state activity than Ruby and I were used to. Plus she was great at picking out interesting places to visit, like
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caves_of_Hercules" target="_blank">Caves of Hercules</a> and
                Tangier's Phoenician Tombs!

                Now recovering from some post-travel sickness (not COVID, just yucky) we're both diving back into our respective
                works. In particular work is ramping up for me as an organizer of the <a
                    href="https://socialjusticehackathon.com/about.html" target="_blank">Social Justice Hackathon</a> coming up
                this <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/philadelphia-social-justice-hackathon-2024-tickets-829209476867"
                    target="_blank">April 5-7</a>. Besides that main event, we'll also be hosting weekly hack nights starting
                with our first one <a href="https://www.meetup.com/legalhackerspa/events/299578460/" target="_blank">this
                    Thursday</a>! We are still looking for volunteers for the event as well, especially volunteers who can serve
                as project leads. For that role, ideal volunteers have project, product, or volunteer management experience,
                especially in tech settings.

                As spring creeps closer and snowdrops give way to daffodils over the next few weeks, I have a lot of work ahead
                of me. Between the above hackathon, Code for Philly, and my work at Community Legal Services. But also I gotta
                keep riding and exercising when I can because I am still planning to <a
                    href="./blog/back-in-the-saddle.html">ride a 70-mile gravel ride in June</a>. I promise I am not becoming
                one of those hustle-culture tech bros, I just have a busy March ahead of me. Just have to keep reminding myself
                to keep it moving one day at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite it being so busy, I am really looking forward to spring and especially our neighborhood starting to wake
                up from its sleepy winter mode. As much as I can, I am looking to get social and outside as much as possible!
