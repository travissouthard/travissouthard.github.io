            <p>
                Over the past few years, I have been taking in a lot of <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHI61GHNGJM" target="_blank"><em>Solarpunk</em></a> influences.
                Solarpunk is a movement/genre/aesthetic/practice based around ultra-sustainability, averting climate climate
                catastrophe, and community-centric social organization that has been growing and evolving over the past 15
                years, largely starting in Latin America, and I first came across it with Andrew Sage's <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHI61GHNGJM" target="_blank">"What is Solarpunk"</a> video and got
                such a craving for more things like this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Already, I had been looking for more art and literature that makes sustainability look desirable in a
                way that wasn't just corporate greenwashing, but also wasn't just the <a
                    href="https://grist.org/climate/why-is-cottagecore-so-white/" target="_blank">cottage-core fantasy</a>
                or the machismo-filled bushcraft stuff. I read a lot of dystopian fiction as a teen and young adult, and
                like many others, I tired of that sort of imagery being a warning and co-opted by venture capital funded
                companies. I wanted something that could actually serve as both a cultural escape and as a playbook of how
                to improve our odds as a society against climate damage, rising fascism, and increasing apathy in the face
                of both.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solarpunk has already been included in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqJJktxCY9U"
                    target="_blank">greeenwashing campaigns of corporations</a> and is often reduced to "glass towers with
                greenery poking out," but is, and can be so much more. I enjoy reading Solarpunk books like
                <em>Walkaway</em> and <em>Inifinite Detail</em> (both of which have excellent playbooks for decentralized,
                community-based living) as well as art when I can, but I am especially interested in trying to incorporate
                as many of these things into my daily life as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, I would love to stick solar panels and a battery on our house and retrofit it to be as
                sustainable as possible, but that is expensive (to do quickly) and there are smaller things to make life
                more sustainable like remembering that "reduce, reuse, and" are the words that come before "recycle",
                repairing whatever I can, and only buying new things when I need them. In finding a new aesthetic, many of
                us (Americans, especially) are drawn to throw out our current possessions and buy the starter pack of the
                <em>New Thing&trade;</em>. Typically, the answer to "what is the most sustainable ___?" is "The one you
                already have." Of course, if the object in question is a fuel-hungry thing that creates a lot of waste, that
                may be worth retiring and replacing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://spokesandstitches.com/pages/workshops" target="_blank">Ruby</a> has taught me a lot about
                repairing clothes, and I know how to maintain our bikes and some parts of our house. But, I have been
                recently trying to learn more about repairing electronics like my early 2015 Macbook I bought used from a
                previous employer and I would love to <a href="https://github.com/iffybooks/host-a-website-at-home"
                    target="_blank">migrate this website from GitHub Pages to my own device</a> in our home. Even as it is,
                using a static site that delivers a few kilobytes per page is far more sustainable than serving
                gigabyte-sized packages for websites made of mostly text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like many things, living sustainably is an iterative process and we all learn more each day. Even as <a
                    href="./art/abolish-landlords.html" target="_blank">my own work</a> is influenced by it, my interest in
                Solarpunk is less trying to <em>look</em> a certain way, but rather how to <em>behave</em>. I certainly
                don't claim to be doing this perfectly, but I aspire to it and am currently slowly transforming an empty lot
                by our house into a garden/pocket-park, learning to repair electronics and clothes, and engaging my local
                communities in these as much as I can. What small, slow progress are you making?
