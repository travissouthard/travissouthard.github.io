                New year. I am newly 35 years old and just came through a tough but still good year. Many
                years have been tough for me, but in the grand scheme of tough years, 2023 was pretty easy on me. This year I
                was laid off from a dream job, joined the leadership at <a href="https://codeforphilly.org/"
                    target="_blank">Code for Philly</a>, didn't ride my bike enough, worked in a large corporate environment
                that I dislike, but ended the year by securing a job that fits my values. Ruby and I also have some travel plans
                that I will talk about more once we're back home!
            </p>
            <p>
                New job. I will be joining <a href="https://clsphila.org/" target="_blank">Community Legal Services</a> this
                week as a Developer and Data Analyst in their Digital Innovation Lab. I am excited to be working on local issues
                and helping Philadelphians, but I am also just excited to be working at a values-driven organization once again!
                CLS is a great organization and I have been a fan of their work for some time.
            </p>
            <p>
                New habits. I have a new <a href="https://bonk.lol/2024A" target="_blank">Bonk planner</a> and want to leverage
                it to build up some new habits and routines I have been wanting to build. I am using it as part tracker and part
                journal. Each day I note: How many cups of coffee I've had (less than I thought). Which meals I've prepared.
                When I woke up and went to bed. What exercise I did that day. What 3rd place I visited. What tasks I need to do
                and which I did. And finally a highlight list of what happened that day. I have been doing it for a week now and
                it's already given me some insight into my habits and helped me build some new ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was expecting that I would have more reflections I'd like to share from my usual birthday/new year
                introspection, but I think most of that is best left private. I am looking forward to this year, even if it is
                starting with winter (as Gregorian years typically do), but time with friends should at least make that easier.
            </p>
