            <p>
                I started a <a href="../resume">new role</a> at <a href="https://clsphila.org" target="_blank">CLS</a>
                at the beginning of the year. My previous supervisor, Nate, moved on to work at a new workplace, and now
                I am the sole developer at CLS. In fact, I am now a <em>Senior</em> Developer & Data Analyst. It's
                certainly been an adjustment to be managing our projects, administering our case management system, and
                being my own project manager. But I am making it happen and have finally gotten into a groove.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think I'll be <em>comfortable</em> with managing all these projects until summer (hopefully),
                but I have found the rhythm of the work. Juggling projects and having many different things to work on
                is fun for me and thrilling, for better or worse. The projects themselves are often exciting for the
                tech they use, the topics they address, or even just being a satisfying new way to interact with a
                tedious task. I've been <em>busy</em> but not overwhelmed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also adjusting to the <em>Senior</em> in the title too. It certainly fits the work I'm doing and all
                of the tasks I need to keep up with to make the work happen, but I'm not sure yet if it fits
                <em>me</em>. Only two years ago did I start to feel solidly in the "midlevel" category. But I have
                learned throughout my career that meeting the needs in the space is the work. A bike needs fixing. Data
                needs to be delivered to DHS. A spreadsheet has gotten too complicated and should be a database instead.
                They need to get done, so I need to make them happen. Regardless of my feelings about new words in my title.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the last ten weeks, I have felt myself leveling up and it feels fantastic. Already I was grateful
                to have a job where I get to work on cool projects that help Philadelphians, or at least help our
                caseworkers help Philadelphians. Five days a week I get to do meaningful and autonomous work. A dreamy
                state for a worker. None of this is to gloat, rather to express gratitude and reflect on how I'm
                growing as a developer. I am genuinely enjoying this job and especially the work I get to do.
