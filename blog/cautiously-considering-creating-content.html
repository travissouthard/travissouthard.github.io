        I have been arguing with myself for a while now about getting back into <b><em>content creation</em></b> for the
        past few years. I have started and <s>abandoned</s> moved on from <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99BRZOOC30s&list=PL8hP1JY9f2dh7vnCpoVDSIknMWIk4s55H&pp=gAQBiAQB"
            target="_blank">so many projects</a> over the years. None of them necessarily "gained traction", but I also
        never gave things enough time to really find their audience. I've been consistently thinking for a year now that
        I did enjoy making those things at the time and probably would again.
      </p>
      <p>
          Theoretically this is the "right reason" to be <b><em>creating content</em></b>: Just feeling a drive to make
          things. However, I really despise the phrase/title <em><b>content creator</b></em> for both its
          hand-wavey vagueness and especially the implication that one is not a filmmaker or an illustrator or a writer
          but a machine akin to a meat grinder whose main output is "stuff". This is especially shakey ground to even
          acknowledge considering AI generated <em><b>content</b></em>.
      </p>
      <p>But I suppose I am considering making intentional, scheduled work again. And while I am not quitting my day job
          (certainly not in week 3), I do have an interest in trying to grow an audience and add some commerce to the art.
          And thats where I start to get nervous: When I have started to treat making things for fun as a job they have
          gotten less fun. Specifically resenting time pressure, feeling like I <em>have</em> to make a thing <em>or
              else</em>, and that the things I am making are just not good. Often I felt like the "just to get it done"
          factor was hurting how I felt about making things.
      </p>
      <p>
          Granted, I say all that and yet: I was always far happier having made the thing and seeing it posted than I ever
          was not posting the things that didn't make it. I genuinely enjoy the act of editing a video, hand-placing a
          pixel, and writing a blog post. Making things is fun, and as long as it stays fun I'll be happy to make things.
          If I can continue to make things that make me happy <em>and</em> make some income from it without feeling burned
          out by it, then that would be genuinely dreamy.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is not an announcement of anything in particular. I don't have a specific plan right now, but I suppose
          keep an ear out because I'll be making <em>something</em> soon. Which of course reminds me to remind you that

          So definitely no promises, but lately I have been interested in:
          <ul>
            <li>making code tutorials at an intermediate level for both small projects and language proficiencies</li>
            <li>writing articles about better documentation and project/code organizing</li>
            <li>posting about current projects I'm working on in a journal blog style</li>
          </ul>
