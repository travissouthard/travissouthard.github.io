    <h3 id="and_how_to_make_sure_your_documentation_is_the_best_of_the_best">And how to
        make sure your documentation is the best of the best</h3>
    <p>Documentation is vital for anything open source; from open hardware, to free recipes, to DIY repair
        tutorials, but it is especially vital when it comes to software. Whether you’re a user or a developer,
        documentation provides the “how to” for interacting with any piece of software.</p>
    <p>Since I first started getting into software development two years ago, I’ve learned that documentation
        frequently assumes you already know how to use the item in question, and are using the docs as a reference.
        While acting as a reference material is one of documentation’s important functions, it cannot be the only
        function, but more on that later.</p>

    <h3>What is documentation?</h3>
    <p>First off, what counts as documentation? It’s not just the README.md in a project’s repository. Documentation
        also includes websites, other files in a project repository, comments in your code, commits in your
        codebase, and also chat app channels and threads. Developers also often look to Stack Overflow and GitHub
        discussions when looking for existing solutions for a given problem.</p>
    <p>Having a single “source of truth” for documentation is ideal, but also largely impossible since there are so
        many different places we talk about our projects. Even so, there are good ways to distill these
        conversations into good documentation. At Azavea we are good at taking big architecture decisions and
        recording them in our repos as Architectural Decision Records, also known as ADRs.</p>
    <p>ADRs are excellent for decisions with project-wide implications, but teams also make a lot of decisions in
        seemingly innocuous conversations. Sometimes we have a conversation on Slack, a conference call, or even,
        sometimes, in person. In many cases, any learnings from these conversations goes unrecorded. On the Civic
        Applications team (my team), we try to remedy this issue by putting notes from these chats into a relevant
        issue or pull request on the project’s Github repo.</p>

    <h3>Who is documentation for?</h3>
    <p>Knowing who you are writing your documentation for is key to recording the most important elements. When it
        comes to software, there are two primary types of people trying to learn how it works: developers and users.
    </p>
    <p>You want your users to know how to use the app, especially parts that they won’t need to touch often and
        therefore won’t have as much practice and experience with. While it is important to do your best to design
        the app itself to be intuitive and to be usable without explanation, there will always be users who need an
        explicit explanation of how to use most features.</p>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.azavea.com/blog/2022/08/17/1-for-open-source-financial-support-for-tools-we-use/"
            target="_blank">open source</a> spaces we also want to ensure our contributors
        know how to develop the app. By writing our issues and documentation as clearly as possible, contributors
        are more able to seamlessly jump into a project and follow the conventions of your project without issue.
    </p>
    <p>Documentation is often frequently used as reference for developers who are experienced with this codebase.
        Having a skimmable documentation that is clearly visually and logically broken up helps to improve
        reference-ability so much.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Creating documentation that works for both users and developers is a mutually beneficial effort.&nbsp; When
        contributing developers know how to use the app in question, it is much easier to develop a smooth user
        experience. This being said, users do not need to know how to develop the app. My colleague, Terence,
        pointed out this is similar to a driver not needing to know how the car works to drive it; they just need to
        understand how to use the pedals, wheel, and signals.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>How much does the reader know?</h3>
    <p>One question repeatedly surfaced during my discussions with colleagues about this topic: How much information
        should the documentation assume the reader already has? According to <a
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-good-documentation/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">existing</a> <a
            href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>, it’s <a
            href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/the-eight-rules-of-good-documentation/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">important to assume nothing</a> about the reader. Even though it’s important
        to provide content that avoids leaving readers in the dark, it’s also crucial to avoid overwhelming the
        reader with a giant wall of text or presenting the reader with extraneous, repetitive information.</p>
    <p>In order to prevent overwhelming the reader we recommend visually breaking up the documentation so that it is
        easier to skim or scan through for important information.&nbsp; Breaking up large documents into smaller
        chunks is especially important while generating documentation for a library of components.</p>

    <h3>The shape of docs</h3>
    <p>In journalism, there is a concept called the “inverted pyramid of information” where the broadest, most
        important concepts are at the top of the piece and smaller, less relevant details appear later in the
        article. In talking with our User Experience Team Lead, <a
            href="https://www.azavea.com/about/teammate/catherine-oldershaw/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">Catherine Oldershaw</a>, she told me that in UX this concept is often
        reversed, and instead manifests by managing the cognitive load of an application with a technique called
        “bubble up; drill down”. In other words, more digestible pieces of information bubble to the top and the
        author drills down to more complex details as the documentation is written.&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
        <p>“A great way to check this is to see if the&nbsp; information hierarchy matches the visual hierarchy. Key
            information (high in the information hierarchy) should also be visually prominent (high in the visual
            hierarchy), and more nuanced, detailed information should be lower in the information hierarchy and
            visual hierarchy.”</p>
        <p><b>Catherine Oldershaw</b></p>
    </blockquote>

    <img src="../assets/images/blog/azavea-blog-2.webp"
        alt="An image with big text in the middle that says &quot;you will read this first&quot;, slightly smaller text below that reading &quot;and then you will read this&quot;, slightly smaller text below that readying &quot;then this one&quot;, and finally a line at the top in little print that says &quot;And you will read this last&quot;.">

    <p>During our conversation, Catherine also shared that developers tend to write documentation that follows the
        structure of the project, instead of following a structure that would improve readability. In order to
        maximize readability, it is much more helpful to structure the documentation in a manner that a developer
        new to the project would expect (i.e. with clear and skimmable sections), but this is not the norm. There is
        some serious discretion needed to determine this, but following an organization design the reader is
        familiar with can lead to great success.</p>
    <p>Although it may seem counterintuitive to many developers, repeating important information while generating
        documentation is crucial and doesn’t take away from the piece’s skimmability. As devs, we are taught to
        write DRY code (Don’t Repeat Yourself) which certainly makes more maintainable code. This being
        said,documentation is for teaching as much for reference, and in a previous career I was trained that
        repetition is good for teaching. American reading teachers are trained with the idea that you begin to
        understand a word after you have heard or read it seven times.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While repetition may seem tedious to read, good documentation will explain a concept or abstraction just
        about any time it comes up. This reduces how much the reader needs to move back and forth to understand what
        they are reading and helps to avoid splitting their attention while reading about how to use or develop the
        app. Repetition also helps to make the documentation more skimmable, which is very desirable.</p>

    <h3>A Good Example:</h3>
    <p><a href="https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ant Design</a> is
        a library of React components and represents a great example of effective documentation. When looking
        through their components pages, there is a consistent shape to each component’s write-up.</p>
    <p>There is a small description of what each component is and what it is for, followed by a more in-depth
        description of the particulars of the components and why one may need those different settings. After these
        descriptions, there are examples of variations on the component that show what the different settings and
        props do.</p>

    <img src="../assets/images/blog/azavea-blog-3.webp"
        alt="A screenshot of text that reads &quot;Radio. When To Use: Used to select a single state from multiple options. The difference from Select is that Radio is visible to the user and can facilitate the comparison of choice, which means there shouldn't be too many of them.&quot;" />
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/azavea-blog-4.webp" alt="Screenshots of a variety of buttons " />


    <p>AntD’s component docs also have code examples and interactive sandboxes that are entirely either “opt-in” or
        collapsed so as not to overwhelm the reader. The documentation finishes out with an API reference chart for
        experienced developers to find the particular details like default values or the list of options for any
        specific quality the dev is looking for.</p>

    <img src="../assets/images/blog/azavea-blog-5.webp"
        alt="Interactive examples from Antd of buttons, with one code example open">
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/azavea-blog-6.webp"
        alt="A screenshot of an API reference example for Antd’s radio button">

    <p>The shape of these documents make it easy for devs new to AntD to easily get a descriptive walk through what
        this component does and why its different pieces are useful. Having an API chart at the bottom is also great
        for veteran AntD users to quickly look up specifics like default values, types, and a quick reminder. Having
        benefits for both audiences doesn’t detract from either experience, and the consistency of this format
        amongst all the different components means once you understand the pattern it’s very easy to look through
        any component’s doc for the details of any specific needs.</p>

    <h3>A specific odd example</h3>

    <p>As said above, documentation is more than just README.md and /docs pages. One of the bits we do well at
        Azavea, especially on the Civic Applications team, is using commit messages as documentation. This may seem
        odd to some developers, since many do not consider this to be documentation.</p>
    <p>When looking at what may read at first as an odd piece of code, we check the git blame and see what commit
        and PR this piece of code came from. Ideally this PR will say what was trying to be solved as a whole and
        the commit will say what was specifically changed to do this.</p>
    <p>Our local master of this technique is Senior Software Engineer, <a
            href="https://www.azavea.com/about/teammate/terence-tuhinanshu/" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">Terence Tuhinanshu</a> of the Climate Applications team, who gave some great
        insight into this. At Azavea we try to write pull requests that address a particular issue and contain a
        list of commits that each make one change and title that change clearly in less than 50 characters (the
        limit to display in one line in GitHub), with optional details for further motivation. Each of these commits
        should appear in order, start with a present tense verb, and ideally read like steps in a recipe for how to
        make this PR.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/azavea/iow-boundary-tool/pull/50/commits" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">Here are</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/pull/3432/commits" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">a few</a>
        <a href="https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/pull/3406/commits" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">examples</a> of this that Terence has put together over the years, including
        <a href="https://github.com/WikiWatershed/model-my-watershed/pull/2527/commits" target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> while Terence was into
        <a href="https://gitmoji.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitmoji</a>
    </p>
    <p>The recipe part here is a nice analogy since recipes often fit a clear format that we often skim through and
        recheck each time we want to make a particular piece of craft. These steps should each be performed on their
        own and written with simple language to describe the action taken. A developer looking through this should
        be able to look through these steps and see how to recreate this themself or undo this work.</p>
    <p><strong>So, what makes good documentation?</strong></p>
    <p>There are many things that contribute to quality of documentation but to boil it down to a referenceable list
        we can say that good documentation is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Skimmable</li>
        <li>Centralized (as much as possible)</li>
        <li>Consistently shaped</li>
        <li>Structured to the needs of the reader</li>
        <li>Holistic</li>
        <li>But also referenceable</li>
    </ul>
