# Minesweeper
## By Travis Southard
### Based on the classic game

### I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0No1JDc6vE) to figure out the basics of the game setup.

### Built with:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery

### Using on your own system:
Feel free to fork this and clone it to your local repo.
Because it's a static page, you'll only need a text editor and browser.
Once you have it cloned locally, you only need to `open index.html` in your CLI or open the `index.html` from your GUI folder finder.
