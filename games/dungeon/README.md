### What is it?
A fun side project that is an exploration-based role-playing game with (what I hope will be) an open world. Imagine a less combat-focused *Legend of Zelda* game.

This will be built with React for the game itself and with a separate backend for players to make accounts to save their games. 

### What's planned for this?
- Grid-based world with tile-based graphics
    - 32x32 pixel tiles
    - 4:3 aspect ratio
    - Desktop and mobile playability
    - Plays within browser
- Game's story will be told through world's objects and characters
- Dungeons with varying levels of difficulty and prizes
- Sound effects! (I want to learn how they work in app-building)
- Handmade world with some randomized elements
- Passage of time

### Timeline
This has no direct timeline, since I'll be working on it in my spare time, but it is something I want to work on consistently. I will try to put together a Github project to link here to show progress.

The steps will loosely be:
- Building out the base world and display
- Creating player movement
- Creating player functions like:
    - Interaction with world
    - Combat
    - Puzzles
- Creating overworld layout
- Creating way to move from each portion of the world to the next
- Refining overarching story
- Creating game art
- Implementing story into world's elements and exploration
